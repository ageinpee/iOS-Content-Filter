# Functionallity
This simple iOS-Application can intercept, analyze and block networktraffic based on a list of domains. The list of blacklisted domains is taken from the exodus-privacy lab (https://etip.exodus-privacy.eu.org/) by default. The list can be edited in the app though. 
All intercepted network-requests can be exported to a json-file for further analyzation.
